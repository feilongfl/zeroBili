Just click that message, then ZeroNet will update itself automatically.\n> If you don't see a message there, in the top left, to the right of the \"Hello ZeroNet_\" text is a menu (3 vertical dots button). There you can check which version you are on right now, the version number is the second last item in the menu, you might already be on 0.6.0.\n\nthank you very much! It has been updated to 0.6.0",
