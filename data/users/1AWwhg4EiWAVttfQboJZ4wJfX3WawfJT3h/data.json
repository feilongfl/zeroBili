If I delete a site I submitted which has some inner address, like [this one](http://192.168.1.110:43110/1GiJUPsfiS3LWCyZj5urW1Rt2q9WwRh4wB/?Post:15:ZeroNet+-+Tips,+tricks+and+beginners%27+questions). The sites I submitted after this one will all get deleted. Repeatable. Hope for a quick fix. Also thx for the nice new site.\n\nAnd a small problem: if the title of a site is too long, the 'EDIT' button will get hidden.",
