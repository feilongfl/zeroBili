I saw that many Chinese people are using it to bypass the great firewall. \n\nI have been using resilio sync to transfer videos to China but it was recently blocked by China. I am thinking of using this software as a way to transfer videos and audios to China. It will use a lot of bandwidth. Do you think it is ok to do that? Is it practical? How would the transfer speed be? Thanks! Feel free to email me through zeromail. my id is zero ccn.",
