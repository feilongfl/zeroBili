Also as we've seen, crypto is crazy volatile and not as anonymous as people claim.\n\nIf you're worried about volatility, you can exchange your crypto into fiat currency weekly.\nI think people who receive money through Patreon or their public wallet address are happy to get some money for their content (if we're talking youtube/soundcloud type of apps) so wouldn't worry too much. \nBut, if you're worried about privacy, you can use anonymous cryptocurrencies.",
